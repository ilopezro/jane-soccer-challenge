# Design Doc

## Context

I am tasked in creating a program/script that takes in a text document with a list of match results from any given league and outputs the top three teams at the end of every match day.

## Proposed Solution

This program will be written in Typescript to ensure the we have typesafe code. Given the inital readthrough of the prompt, there are a couple of things I want to ensure do not fall through the cracks:

- We are making sure that we are taking in the appropriate command line arguments
  - Solution: We are aborting when given too little or too many arguments because we only care about being provided the text document that contains all the scores
- We are accounting for input documents that are not neatly organized/not formatted correctly or neatly
  - Solution: We can catch each line's input & verify each line contains the right information through regex patterns. I will be making use of a familiar [regex generator](https://regex-generator.olafneumann.org/?sampleText=Capitola%20Seahorses%201%2C%20Aptos%20FC%200&flags=i&onlyPatterns=false&matchWholeLine=false&selection=) and making sure to generate unformatted text input docs and test this behavior

Another issue we have to account for is the fact that there is no set delimiter for an end of a matchday. I plan on using an object to keep track of the teams & their points; however, the downside to using an object to keep track of teams & their points is that we'd need to create a different object that stores teams in points & alphabetical order or map through the object and create a new object/array in place to print.

To read through the text file provided, I will be using Node's built-in [`fs` package](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html).

### Testing Approach

I will be testing my program as a whole using Test Drive Development (TDD). I've recently found that TDD has given me a little bit more freedom to play around with my implementation, especially when I am attempting to refactor some code and DRY out parts of it. I will be using Jest as my testing framework.

### Continous Integration

Time permitting, I will be using Github Action & Pull Requests to ensure that what goes into the `main` branch is code that has been reviewed at least once & that the written tests are all passing!
